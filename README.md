# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project:

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world.
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price.
This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, 
though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. 

Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.Thanks to the rise in information technologies, 
it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. 
These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, The data is provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, 
to uncover bike share usage patterns.

# Goal to complete the Project 

In this project, I need to use the Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I also need to code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Plus, I make a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

##### The Goal to Complete the project:

               FIND: 
   
### 1) Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

### 2) Popular stations and trip

- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

### 3) Trip duration

- total travel time
- average travel time

### 4) User info

- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

##### Another Files in Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data:

- bikeshare.py is interpretated in python 
- chicago.csv : record of the city
- new_york_city.csv : record of the city
- washington.csv : record of the city
### 

##### Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data uses some open source projects to work properly:

* [Python 3] - jupyter notebook is an open source and used to data analyze with python code
* [ipython] - use it as a terminal
* [numpy] - is a fundamental scientific computing.
* [Pandas] - uses to clean, organize, convert, and merge the data.
